IFIH1	IFIH1 	Q9BYX4	IFIH1_HUMAN	Interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1	64135	Innate immune receptor which acts as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and plays a major role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Its ligands include mRNA lacking 2'-O-methylation at their 5' cap and long-dsRNA (>1 kb in length).
IL23R	IL23R	Q5VWK5	IL23R_HUMAN	Interleukin-23 receptor	149233	Associates with IL12RB1 to form the interleukin-23 receptor. Binds IL23 and mediates T-cells, NK cells and possibly certain macrophage/myeloid cells stimulation probably through activation of the Jak-Stat signaling cascade.
IL27	IL27	Q8NEV9	 IL27A_HUMAN	Interleukin-27 subunit alpha	246778	Associates with EBI3 to form the IL-27 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity.
IL2RA	IL2RA	P01589	IL2RA_HUMAN	Interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha	3559	Receptor for interleukin-2. The receptor is involved in the regulation of immune tolerance by controlling regulatory T cells (TREGs) activity. TREGs suppress the activation and expansion of autoreactive T-cells.
KEAP1	KEAP1	 Q14145	KEAP1_HUMAN	Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1	9817	Acts as a substrate adapter protein for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex formed by CUL3 and RBX1 and targets NFE2L2/NRF2 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, thus resulting in the suppression of its transcriptional activity and the repression of antioxidant response element-mediated detoxifying enzyme gene expression.
LCE3B	LCE3B	 Q5TA77	LCE3B_HUMAN	Late cornified envelope protein 3B	353143	Precursors of the cornified envelope of the stratum corneum.
NFKB1	NFKB1	 P19838	NFKB1_HUMAN	Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit	4790	NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis.
NXPE1	NXPE1	Q8N323	NXPE1_HUMAN	NXPE family member 1	120400	Not Found in uniprot
OR5B21	OR5B21	A6NL26	OR5BL_HUMAN	Olfactory receptor 5B21	219968	Odorant receptor
OSMR	OSMR	Q99650	OSMR_HUMAN	Oncostatin-M-specific receptor subunit beta	9180	Associates with IL31RA to form the IL31 receptor. Binds IL31 to activate STAT3 and possibly STAT1 and STAT5. Capable of transducing OSM-specific signaling events.
